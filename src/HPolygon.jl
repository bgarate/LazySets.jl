"""
    HPolygon{N<:Real} <: AbstractHPolygon{N}

Type that represents a convex polygon in constraint representation whose edges
are sorted in counter-clockwise fashion with respect to their normal directions.

### Fields

- `constraints` -- list of linear constraints, sorted by the angle

### Notes

The default constructor assumes that the given list of edges is sorted.
It *does not perform* any sorting.
Use `addconstraint!` to iteratively add the edges in a sorted way.

- `HPolygon(constraints::Vector{LinearConstraint{<:Real}})`
  -- default constructor
- `HPolygon()`
  -- constructor with no constraints
- `HPolygon(S::LazySet)` -- constructor from another set

    σ(d::AbstractVector{<:Real}, P::HPolygon{N})::Vector{N} where {N<:Real}

Return the support vector of a polygon in a given direction.

### Input

- `d`             -- direction
- `P`             -- polygon in constraint representation
- `linear_search` -- (optional, default: see below) flag for controlling whether
                     to perform a linear search or a binary search

### Output

The support vector in the given direction.
The result is always one of the vertices; in particular, if the direction has
norm zero, any vertex is returned.

### Algorithm

Comparison of directions is performed using polar angles; see the overload of
`<=` for two-dimensional vectors.

For polygons with `BINARY_SEARCH_THRESHOLD = 10` or more constraints we use a
binary search by default.
